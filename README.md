# PS3 Video Converter

A simple Python script to batch convert video files to be playable on an unmodified PS3.

Drag and drop videos, directories on the script and it will convert them using FFMPEG and put them in a converted directory.

# CRT_RESOLUTION
Videos with a quality higher than 480p will be downscaled to 480p as I made this to play back on a CRT TV.
Set CRT_RESOLUTION = False to disable this.
